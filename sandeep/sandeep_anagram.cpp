//Write a logic such that it takes two strings as inputs, and find whether they are anagrams to each other 

//Anagrams:- Two strings are said to be anagrams, if they contains same characters, only order of characters are different.

// example1:- abcde, dcaeb (these two are anagrams)
// example2:- aabcd, abcdd (these two are not anagrams)
